Specs-Kit: Document Management & Control Application
1. Purpose & Goals

The application will replace semi-manual document management with a controlled, ISO-aligned platform that:

Ensures compliance with ISO 9001:2015 (Clause 7.5 – Documented Information).

Automates naming conventions (AAA-BB-CCC-DDD-XXX).

Provides searchable, metadata-driven retrieval.

Streamlines review, approval, publication, and archiving.

Maintains a full audit trail.

2. Actors / User Roles
Role	Description	Typical Permissions
End User	Staff needing access to published documents.	Search, view, download PDFs.
Document Owner	Responsible for content accuracy and approvals.	Submit revisions, review, approve/reject.
Document Controller	Maintains documents within the DMS.	Upload, manage metadata, enforce codes, publish, archive.
System Administrator (IT)	Maintains system, accounts, integrations.	Full system access, security management.
Management / QMS	Provides oversight and compliance checks.	Run reports, approve changes to procedures.
3. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
End Users

As an End User, I want to search documents by title, code, or keyword so that I can quickly find the correct document.
✅ Criteria: Search results must return <2 seconds, metadata must be indexed.

As an End User, I want to be confident that the document I’m viewing is the latest approved version.
✅ Criteria: System prevents access to obsolete versions; latest version is clearly labelled.

Document Owners

As a Document Owner, I want to submit revisions for review so that updates are approved before use.
✅ Criteria: Revisions trigger workflow: submit → review → approval → publish.

As a Document Owner, I want to review and approve minor revisions directly to speed up updates.
✅ Criteria: Minor revision workflow configurable for Owner-only approval.

Document Controllers

As a Document Controller, I want the system to validate filenames against the AAA-BB-CCC-DDD-XXX format so that errors are prevented.
✅ Criteria: Upload blocked unless filename and metadata are valid.

As a Document Controller, I want to publish documents as PDFs for end-user access while storing source files securely.
✅ Criteria: Published PDF accessible in DMS; source file restricted.

As a Document Controller, I want to archive obsolete versions automatically so that End Users cannot access them.
✅ Criteria: Archiving triggered upon new version approval; history retained in audit logs.

System Administrators

As an Admin, I want to manage user roles and access so that permissions are aligned with responsibilities.
✅ Criteria: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enforced; integration with SSO (Microsoft 365).

Management / QMS

As QMS, I want reports on document status (e.g., pending review, overdue for revision) so that compliance is monitored.
✅ Criteria: Dashboard includes compliance KPIs; exportable in PDF/Excel.

4. Core Behaviours

Enforce document ID schema (AAA-BB-CCC-DDD-XXX).

Validate mandatory metadata at upload.

Prevent duplicate IDs.

Automatic archiving of obsolete versions.

Approval workflows configurable for major/minor revisions.

Role-based access control.

Notification system (review due, approvals pending, upcoming expiry).

5. Models (Data Structures)
Document
Document {
  ID: string (AAA-BB-CCC-DDD-XXX)
  Title: string
  Version: string (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
  Status: enum (Draft, Review, Approved, Archived, Obsolete)
  Owner: UserID
  Controller: UserID
  Metadata: {
    CompanyCode: string
    SubsidiaryCode: string
    DepartmentCode: string
    DocumentTypeCode: string
    IssueDate: date
    ReviewDate: date
    Keywords: [string]
    Description: string
  }
  Files: {
    PDF: file
    Source: file (restricted)
  }
  ChangeHistory: [ChangeLogEntry]
}

Audit Log
AuditLog {
  ID: string
  DocumentID: string
  Action: string (Created, Revised, Approved, Archived, Accessed)
  User: UserID
  Timestamp: datetime
}

Code Lists
CodeList {
  CompanyCodes: [AAA]
  SubsidiaryCodes: [BB]
  DepartmentCodes: [CCC]
  DocumentTypeCodes: [DDD]
}

6. Actions (Functions)

Upload Document → validates code + metadata, stores PDF + source.

Submit Revision → triggers workflow.

Approve/Reject Document → version increments; publishes PDF.

Archive/Obsolete Document → moves version to restricted archive.

Search & Retrieve Document → metadata-driven, full-text search.

Generate Reports → compliance metrics, pending reviews, expiry notifications.

Manage Code Lists → restricted to Document Controllers / QMS.

7. Data Requirements

Master Code List (AAA, BB, CCC, DDD).

Documents with version history.

Metadata (mandatory + recommended).

Immutable Audit Logs.

User & Role definitions.

8. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Search results <2 seconds for typical queries.

Security: RBAC, SSO integration, audit logs immutable.

Compliance: Align with ISO 9001:2015 Clause 7.5, GDPR, internal Data Retention Policy.

Availability: 99.5% uptime.

Scalability: Support 20+ subsidiaries, thousands of documents.

Usability: Modern UI (Vue/Tailwind/HeadlessUI), role-based dashboards, responsive.

9. UX Guidelines

Dashboard: Role-specific (e.g., Controllers see pending approvals, QMS sees compliance KPIs).

Search: Prominent bar with filters (Company, Subsidiary, Department, Type, Status).

Upload Form: Auto-suggest codes from Code Lists, mandatory metadata fields.

Document View: Shows PDF + metadata, version, change history.

Notifications: Inline + email alerts for approvals/reviews.
